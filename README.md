###About

The mobile version to completent the Presidential Wellness Challenge @Grinnell College.

The President’s Wellness Challenge is a 12-week event for students, staff, and faculty. The goal of the challenge is to motivate wellness behaviors in a number of dimensions. President Kington will also be participating in the challenge and publicly posting his progress to help motivate our campus community.

The challenge encourages intentional wellness in four areas:
SLEEP. How many days per week can you get a solid 8 hours? What do you need to do to make time for this?
EAT. How many days per week can you get the recommended 5 servings of fruits and vegetables?
MOVE. How many days per week can you get in at least 30 minutes of movement?
RESTORE. How many days per week can you participate in an activity that restores you—meditation, hiking, playing with your child or grandchild, reading, writing, attending church, volunteering, baking bread—whatever recharges you.

For each college community member (students, staff, faculty) who completes 12 weeks of the challenge, the College will donate to a local wellness charity!
